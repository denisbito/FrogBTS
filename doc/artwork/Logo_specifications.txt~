SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE FROG BTS LOGO
===============================================================================

1. Start with a 300x46 pixel image (300 pixel width, 46 pixel height), with an
opaque (for now) background (suggested color: #506a3e).


2. Create a new layer, and on it draw a perfect circle, with a diameter of 36
pixels, from coordinates (x,y) = (5,5) to (x,y) = (41,41), and fill it with
the color white. Using the GIMP - the GNU image manipulation program - the
process is described below:

2.1. Use the ellipse selection tool to draw the circle. Tool specifications:
- Antialiasing;
- Feather edges, with radius of 1.0.
2.2. Use the pencil tool (with a thick brush - circle (11), perhaps) to fill in
the selection with white. Stroke only once (click the mouse once and hold it
down) and drag over the selection, including the borders, to paint uniformly.


3. Still in the same layer as the previous circle, draw a new circle, with a
diameter of 34 pixels, from coordinates (x,y) = (7,7) to (x,y) (the process is
analogous to the one described in the last item).
